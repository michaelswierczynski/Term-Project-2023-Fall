# The Big Idea
## The purpose of this project is to explore and determine if a bettor would be profitable to favor home teams in Division 1 Men’s Collegiate Basketball (NCAA). This will allow us to identify specific teams within the league to either tail (continue to bet money on) or fade (stop betting on) specific teams. Although “home team advantage” has been explored in depth over the years, it has seen a decline due to various reasons like the lack of refereeing bias. However, it is difficult to find a trustworthy sources to acknowledge potentially profitable trends for individual teams within this realm. What is most interesting is to see if specific teams have performed significantly better if they are playing at home and to target those colleges within our analysis. 
## Some topics that we will explore is winning percentages and records when playing at home or playing at an opponent’s arena. It could also be valuable to look at when teams have a long home stretch, where they have multiple games back-to-back without the need to travel. The teams themselves will be compared on a point-value basis for stronger teams to not skew results. Since this is the case, we will be looking at “spreads” which give or take points to teams based on probability of them winning or losing. This gives us a standardized and non-skewed method of evaluating Men’s NCAA Basketball teams. 

# Learning Objectives
## Our learning objectives for this project will be:
### •	Finding value in specific trends within the collegiate sports world that will show profitable systems
### •	Building a model from live data in sports.
### o	Scraping that data from the internet
### •	Structuring code and defining functions to evaluate homefield/ home court advantage for specific teams in NCAA Men’s Basketball.
### •	Taking a user’s risk into consideration because any betting always involves a bettor’s willingness to risk more or less.
### •	Being able to clean and sort through data.

# Implementation Plan
## Our implementation plan for this project is to research sports data through SportsRadar API. This is one of the most recommended sources that has the most recent and accurate data relating to both collegiate and professional sports. If this does not work, we can alter our data source to an API like the one that ESPN offers. SportsRadar is also very good because it offers information on betting lines and odds along with the actual outcomes of the games too. By leveraging this site, it will allow us to execute our goals. 
# Project Schedule
## Our project schedule overview is:
### •	Project Proposal: November 10th
### •	Collecting and cleaning data: Finish by November 17th
### •	Formulating Python code: Start by November 18th | End by November 25th 
### •	Analyze results: End by December 1st 
### •	Project Website: End by December 8th 
### •	Code Submission: December 9th

# Collaboration Plan
## Our collaboration plan is both going to be independent and collective. With this into consideration, every part will be reviewed by each partner in order to ensure best results. For example, it would be much easier for one person to drive cleaning the data while the other partner helps with ideas and inputs. On the other hand, it will be essential that both partners collaborate on creating functions and structuring the code. Throughout the project, there will be collaboration on most sections, however, it will be a case by case basis to ensure efficiency and accuracy. 
# Risks and Limitations
## Some significant risks or threats are evaluating each team within the league with a value to determine their skill level. Of course, a team would have a “home court advantage” when that team is very good for that year. However, what we want to understand is for the “average team” is being at home a competitive advantage and are there specific arenas/fields that have a greater advantage than others? For example, Duke University Men’s Basketball has been dominant over the past decade, however we would like to analyze teams like  University of Kentucky or Gonzaga. Some other risks that we might face is the fact that sportsbooks adjust the betting lines for the book to end up profitable in the long term. What will be difficult is to find a profitable solution for the bettor. We might need to adjust our methodologies and goals to find trends with individual teams rather than an entire league.
# Additional Course Content
## Some topics that would be beneficial before starting the project is to learn more about data cleaning. We also want to ensure that the data is accurate.
